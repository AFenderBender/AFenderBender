- 👋 Hi, I’m @AFenderBender
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about the wonderful world of tech (LOL)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate on GitHub
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that I master - and they aren't a lot concerning IT, though. I'll get there!
- 📫 How to reach me: just send a message here, I'll be around!
